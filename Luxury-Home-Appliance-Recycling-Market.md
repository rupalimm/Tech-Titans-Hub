These appliances often contain valuable materials like copper, aluminum, and advanced composites, making them key targets for recycling efforts. With the rise in adoption of smart home technologies, many cleaning appliances now include electronic components that require careful handling during the recycling process. As consumers increasingly prioritize sustainable living, the need for specialized recycling processes for these appliances is growing. Additionally, climate control appliances, such as air conditioners and luxury heating systems, are also contributing to the market growth.
